Description: The curl() function provides a drop-in replacement for base url()
    with better performance and support for http 2.0, ssl (https://, ftps://),
    gzip, deflate and other libcurl goodies. This interface is implemented
    using the RConnection API in order to support incremental processing of
    both binary and text streams. If you are looking for a more-user-friendly
    http client, try the RCurl or httr packages instead.
