Title: A Connection Interface to Libcurl.
Version: 0.1
Date: 2014-11-17
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen.ooms@stat.ucla.edu>
Description: The curl() function provides a drop-in replacement for base url()
    with better performance and support for http 2.0, ssl (https, ftps), gzip,
    deflate and other libcurl goodies. This interface is implemented using the
    RConnection API in order to support incremental processing of both binary
    and text streams. If you are looking for a more user friendly http client,
    try the RCurl or httr packages instead.
