> The curl() and curl_download() functions provide highly
  configurable drop-in replacements for base url() and download.file() with
  better performance, support for encryption (https, ftps), gzip compression,
  authentication, and other libcurl goodies. The core of the package implements a
  framework for performing fully customized requests where data can be processed
  either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection
  interfaces. Some knowledge of libcurl is recommended; for a more-user-friendly
  web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this package with http
  specific tools and logic.
