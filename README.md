A Connection Interface to Libcurl
---------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeroenooms/curl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeroenooms/curl)

> The curl() function provides a drop-in replacement for base url()
  with better performance and support for http 2.0, ssl (https://, ftps://),
  gzip, deflate and other libcurl goodies. This interface is implemented
  using the RConnection API in order to support incremental processing of
  both binary and text streams. If you are looking for a more-user-friendly
  http client, try the RCurl or httr packages instead.
